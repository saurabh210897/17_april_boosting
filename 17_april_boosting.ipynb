    "# Gradient Boosting Regression is a machine learning technique that belongs to the ensemble learning family. It is primarily used for regression tasks,\n",
    "# where the goal is to predict continuous numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The gradient boosting regression algorithm combines multiple weak prediction models, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictive model. \n",
    "# It works by iteratively building new models that predict the residuals (the differences between the actual target values\n",
    "# and the predictions of the previous models) and then adding these new models to the ensemble.\n",
    "# This process continues until a certain stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum number of models or achieving a desired level of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The term \"gradient\" in gradient boosting refers to the use of gradient descent optimization to minimize a loss function, such as mean squared error (MSE) \n",
    "# or mean absolute error (MAE). In each iteration, the algorithm calculates the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the current ensemble's \n",
    "# predictions and fits a new model to this gradient. The model is then added to the ensemble, and the predictions are updated by adding the predictions of the new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# By combining multiple weak models in a boosting manner, gradient boosting regression can effectively capture complex relationships in the data and\n",
    "# make accurate predictions. It is known for its ability to handle nonlinear relationships, handle missing values, and robustness against outliers.\n",
